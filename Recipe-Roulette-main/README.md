# Recipe Roulette

Recipe Roulette is a web application dedicated to connecting users who want to diversify their diets based on a shared interest in food. To stop food from getting boring, this application selects a "Recipe of the Day" each day from the collection of posts made by all users. This is why we're called "Recipe Roulette" - every day the recipe is left up to chance!

# Description

At its core, Recipe Roulette is based around users sharing posts about their favorite recipes. After creating an account, users can make posts featuring a short description, a picture, a separated list of ingredients, a paragraph describing how to make the recipe, and nutritional data. Other users can interact with these posts by liking it or leaving a comment. Posts can also be searched for based on their ingredients and allergy restrictions. Users can easily access their own posts and posts they've liked from their own profile page. Users can also modify their own profile, being able to change their profile picture, display name, favorite food, and allergies.
